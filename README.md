Employee Data Analysis & Management for DataTech Solutions**
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Analyst Bootcamp (LePont, 2024). The goal is to analyze and secure multiple datasets related to employees of DataTech Solutions, a U.S.-based company. The analysis involves data cleaning, transformation, database creation, and SQL queries to extract key insights.
🎯 Objectives
1.	Data Wrangling: Collect, clean, and transform raw employee data.
2.	Database Design: Build a relational database (SQL) to store and efficiently query data.
3.	Data Queries: Answer key business questions using SQL queries.
🔧 Technologies & Tools Used
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data preprocessing and visualization.
•	SQL (HeidiSQL, MySQL/PostgreSQL) for database management and querying.
•	Jupyter Notebook for documenting data processing steps.
•	Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) created with QuickDatabaseDiagrams.
•	Excel for presenting query results.
🛠 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Wrangling & Cleaning
•	Loaded 6 employee datasets.
•	Identified and handled duplicates, missing values, and format inconsistencies.
•	Ensured data consistency before storing in the database.
2️⃣ Database Creation & Management
•	Designed a relational database schema for optimal data storage.
•	Defined primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between tables.
•	Imported cleaned CSV files into the SQL database.
3️⃣ SQL Queries & Analysis
The project includes SQL queries to answer key business questions, such as:
•	List all employees with their full name and address.
•	Count the number of employees by gender.
•	Extract meaningful KPIs based on employee data.
📂 Project Deliverables
